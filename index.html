          <p>The main purpose for the Integrated Project (IP2) were to work on a group group project whereby we were
            tasked to primarily develop a responsive web application to display a variety of geospatial information 
            through the use of online data resources, APIs calls. The sources of the information to be displayed were 
            varied and each required a specific set of the programming interfaces. Looking at our menu bar, it allows 
            users to access various significant web pages including Knowing more about GeoJSON, Weather, Earthquake, 
            and an additional mapping selected by our team as required from the project requirements. 
            For example, through navigating on this web, a user can get to know more about what is GeoJSON, 
            can interact with the web to view weather, earthquake, geography regions elevation points mapping. </p>
            Other than the site content, this IP2 also has other contents including a poster, an individual and 
            The group report. The group report enclosed in the submitted folders entails the design process, 
            the implementation as well as clarifying set of core technologies that were employed in the development 
            process. The choice of the technologies used are well explained and their justification included. 
            It also introduces the team members, the intended objectives of the project, as well as outlining a
            reflection of the team successes, failures and a review of what could have been done better, and 
            what to improve for future IP2.
